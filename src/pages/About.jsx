            <p>Sleepless Dead has always been enamored with music. At one point, they could play over 15 different instruments. Today, they write lyrics, sing, compose, and play guitara nd piano. Jack, the artist behind sleepless dead, has an Associates of Music Production which they graduated as valedictiorian. Jack can create an entire piece of music from conception to completion by themself. Ever tring to improve their craft, they have recently taken an interest in learning mandolin, creating music samples, foley, and AFX. Sleepless Dead also gained some minor video editing skills, music and cultural hhistory, and advanced knowledge on writing about/analyzing pieces of entertainment media consumed by the public. Sleepless Dead is mostly working on their own projects right now but is always interested in hearing about any project for which you think they might be a fit. They submit and sometimes are accepted to work surrounding sync briefs, audiobook recording, and the like. Sleepless Dead has many heartwrenching tales of severe and extrenuating obstacles they have overcome throughout hteir life. They grew up poor disabled, and queer. They were exposed to childhood trauma, chronic homelessness, and domestic violence. They also enjoy many a so called nerdy/geeky fandom or passtime. Whatever the project, Jack Gypsy knows how to add a touch of realism and passion to any song. They slo possess skills in many other fields including automotive maintenance and tax preparation. They even built this website solo with React in Javascript! Please use the contact page if they and their music or skills sound like the right fit for your project.</p>

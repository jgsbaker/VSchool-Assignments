        <p> I have love musuic all my life. As a kid I took every music class and learned every instrument I had access to. As a student, I was top of my class and graduated as Valedictorian. I also love audio, technology, and entertainment. I can build a website, put together a video, or do an entire song in nearly any style for nearly any purpose completely by myself from start to finish. I am easy to work with and a passionate worker who wants to bring my own unique voice while still delivering above and beyond the expectations. My personal music does tend to be somewhere in the alternative rock area, but I've done songs in many styles. I am reslilient and capable of working through difficult situations and maintaining positivity. I fought great odds to get this far, and so there's not much I feel I can't do with effort and patience. If you need someone with skills in audio, music, coding, and technical troubleshooting, I'm the person you are looking for.</p>
